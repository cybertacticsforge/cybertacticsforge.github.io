            <h2>Forging Future Cyber Operators</h2>
            <p>
                CyberTacticsForge is dedicated to closing the critical gap in practical cybersecurity education. We provide students with authentic, hands-on experiences that transform curiosity into career-ready skills. Our work is focused on two primary initiatives: running a flagship regional competition and empowering educators to build similar programs in their own communities.

            <h2>The pps{CyberTacticsFest} Competition</h2>
            <p>
                Our flagship event, the pps{CyberTacticsFest}, is more than just a competition; it’s a capstone experience built on a season of hands-on training. We move beyond theory by giving students real tools to solve real problems in a competitive, team-based environment. Participants learn offensive and defensive techniques through weekly training, mentorship, and mini-challenges, ensuring that every skill used in the final event has been transparently taught and practiced. This approach builds confidence, fosters teamwork, and makes cybersecurity accessible to all students, regardless of their background.

            <h2>Supporting Students and Educators</h2>
            <p>
                Our mission extends beyond a single event. We are building an ecosystem to support young talent and the educators who guide them. This includes:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Infrastructure & Resources:</strong> We act as an intermediary, acquiring and distributing donated hardware like servers and laptops to schools that lack resources.</li>
                <li><strong>Credentialing and Career Prep:</strong> We provide vouchers for industry-standard certifications (e.g., CompTIA Security+), awarding them based on effort and aptitude to level the playing field.</li>
                <li><strong>Regional Support and Expansion:</strong> We assist other schools and regions in establishing their own local competitions by sharing our frameworks, virtual machine images, scripting tools, and lessons learned, helping them grow their own cybersecurity ecosystems.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                CyberTacticsForge exists to transform natural curiosity and competitive spirit into recognized
                talent and lasting opportunity. We foster cybersecurity teams, sharpen their skills with real-
                world offensive and defensive techniques, and grow their potential through strategic challenges,
                mentorship, and competition within a structured, supportive environment.
            </p>
            <h2>vision</h2>
            <p>
                Our vision is to cultivate strategic, ethical minds who recognize the power of their skills, the
                responsibility of their actions, and the impact they can have in securing tomorrow’s world while
                forging a community that grows through mentorship, sharpens through competition, and
                where students are prepared to anticipate and outmaneuver threats.

            <h2>coach</h2>
            <p>
                As a coach, you will be attached to a team of 4-8 students who are expected to learn 1-4 ‘work roles’ each. You will be given access to the cyber.org range to hold practices outside of the normal presentation times. Practice times will be up to you and your team. The content of the practices can be as simple as a review of the concepts and skills taught in the combined practice or a practical exercise for the team, as the combined practices tend to lack the repetitions needed to develop skills.
            </p>
            <h2>mentor</h2>
            <p>
                As a mentor, you will be attached to a single ‘work role’ and the skills associated with it. You will assist in the application and integration of that work role more vertically by helping develop flag locations in the final competition, creating small-team challenges, and presenting the work role during combined practices. The time commitment is task-based, and you will be given access to our tools and platforms to develop feasible and effective practical exercises.
            </p>
            <h2>developer</h2>
            <p>
                As a developer, you will assist in creating the final competition scenario, which involves a fictional school where something mysterious is happening. This requires developing target machines and crafting scenarios that test a broad range of skills. Alternatively, you may help develop capabilities to monitor the competition, such as integrating CTFd for flag submission, implementing SecOnion for automatic scoring, or creating a live scoreboard and broadcast.
